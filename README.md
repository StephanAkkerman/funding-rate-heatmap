## Introduction

This is a well known heatmap for cryptocurrency traders. The goal is to provide a quick overview of the funding rates of current popular cryptocurrencies on Binance. I used the chart found on [Coinglass](https://www.coinglass.com/FundingRateHeatMap) as a reference. The data is then plotted using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
